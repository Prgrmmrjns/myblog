(2017) is my favorite scientific paper. It introduced the Transformer model, which is a powerful architecture for natural language processing tasks. I like it because it's a simple and effective approach to the problem of sequence-to-sequence learning. The figures are also beautiful and the paper is well written.",{"label":82,"content":83},"What is your favorite programming language?","Python. No discussion here. It is just plain simple and works. It is really flexible and has a great community. The only downside is that it is not the fastest language but with special libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, etc. it is really powerful.",{"title":85,"questions":86},"Personal",[87,90,93,96],{"label":88,"content":89},"Regarding the current world situation, what are you most concerned about?","Climate change is a big issue for me. Since the industrial time the average world temperature has increased by 1.5°C. This is already a lot and we need to act now to avoid a catastrophic situation. Else we will be surprised by frequent heat waves, droughts, floods and other extreme weather events. Besides the rise of populism and nationalism is also a big concern. It is important to stay open minded and to listen to each other.",{"label":91,"content":92},"What is your favorite book?","Dune by Frank Herbert.

It is the most complex organ in the body and it is still not fully understood. The brain is where all our thoughts, feelings and coffee cravings come from.
