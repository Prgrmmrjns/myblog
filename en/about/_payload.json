(2017) is my favorite scientific paper. It introduced the Transformer model, which is a powerful architecture for natural language processing tasks. I like it because it's a simple and effective approach to the problem of sequence-to-sequence learning. The figures are also beautiful and the paper is well written.",{"label":81,"content":82},"What is your favorite programming language?","Python. No discussion here. It is just plain simple and works. It is really flexible and has a great community. The only downside is that it is not the fastest language but with special libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, etc. it is really powerful.",{"title":84,"questions":85},"Personal",[86,89,92,95],{"label":87,"content":88},"Regarding the current world situation, what are you most concerned about?","Climate change is a big issue for me.
