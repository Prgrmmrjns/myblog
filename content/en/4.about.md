About me

#subtitle
Hi I am Jonas

#intro
I am a PhD Student based in Aachen, Germany.

I work in the exciting interdisciplinary field of Medical Informatics. I use advanced Machine Learning methods / Artificial Intelligence for making scientific progress that eventually may help improve patient care.

I am excited about the new developments in the field of AI, particularly Large Language Models that offer a great possibility to incorporate more patient data and thereby improve ML systems in clinical settings. On my blog I would like to share my projects and talk about the latest developments in the field of AI in Medicine.

In my free time I love to do Sports. I play Football for a local team, I love running and going to the gym. I am also passionate about healthy and sustainable, plant-based nutrition. Finally, I am also open to meet new people and exchange ideas. Feel free to contact me!
