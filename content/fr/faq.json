It introduced the Transformer model, which is a powerful architecture for natural language processing tasks. I like it because it's a simple and effective approach to the problem of sequence-to-sequence learning. The figures are also beautiful and the paper is well written."

Besides the rise of populism and nationalism is also a big concern. It is important to stay open minded and to listen to each other."
